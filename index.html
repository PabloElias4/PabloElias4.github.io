        <p>One day I was lying on the couch and something exciting came on T.V. it was a circus in Riddell’s creek! I ran outside to tell dad. I will go if you are good. So I started to be really good. First I vacuumed the floor then I cleaned my room. I cleaned dads and mums room too. Dad was very happy the whole house was clean. He even said that I could take a friend. I decided to ask Gemma so I got dads phone and I called Gemma. She said yes I can come well. But there was one problem I didn’t know how much it cost. I sat down so I could see how much it cost it was $2 so I looked in my money box. I found $2 I better not waste it on something finally it was the day of the circus .Dad dropped us off. Dad went shopping; the circus was at the school there were lion’s, clowns and acrobats all sorts of things. It was a happy day now that was a very exciting day.

        <p>ANIMALS or creatures are like us. They feel pain the way we feel pain. Many creatures are hunted and killed for sport. These animals are not obnoxious and should be treated like pets. There are over 10000000 different species of exotic creatures, each more fascinating than the next. There are only a few species of creatures that have actually been discovered. There are about 1000000 more species we haven't yet discovered.</p>
